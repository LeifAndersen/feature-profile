    In olden times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king whose
    daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful that the
    sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever it shone in her
    face.  Close by the king's castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old
    lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the
    king's child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the cool
    fountain, and when she was bored she took a golden ball, and threw it up on
    high and caught it, and this ball was her favorite plaything.})
